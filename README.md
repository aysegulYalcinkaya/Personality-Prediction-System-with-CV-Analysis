# Personality Prediction System with CV Analysis
The process of shortlisting deserving candidates from a large pool of CVs is a challenging task faced by many organizations. Manual evaluation of CVs is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human biases. To overcome these challenges and streamline the selection process, our project aims to develop an advanced software solution that can interpret the personality of candidates by analyzing their CVs. This project will provide a fair CV ranking system, revolutionizing the way candidates are evaluated and selected.
